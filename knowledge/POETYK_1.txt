Background: Effective, well-tolerated oral psoriasis treatments are needed.
Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of deucravacitinib, an oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine
kinase 2 inhibitor, versus placebo and apremilast in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
Methods: Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to deucravacitinib 6 mg every day (n = 332), placebo
(n = 166), or apremilast 30 mg twice a day (n = 168) in the 52-week, double-blinded, phase 3 POETYK
PSO-1 trial (NCT03624127). Coprimary end points included response rates for $75% reduction from
baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and static Physician’s Global Assessment score of
0 or 1 (sPGA 0/1) with deucravacitinib versus placebo at week 16.
Results: At week 16, response rates were significantly higher with deucravacitinib versus placebo or
apremilast for PASI 75 (194 [58.4%] vs 21 [12.7%] vs 59 [35.1%]; P \.0001) and sPGA 0/1 (178 [53.6%] vs 12
[7.2%] vs 54 [32.1%]; P \.0001). Efficacy improved beyond week 16 and was maintained through week 52.
Adverse event rates with deucravacitinib were similar to those with placebo and apremilast.

Procedures
This trial included a 4-week screening period
before study entry, a 16-week placebo- and
apremilast-controlled period, an 8-week apremilastcontrolled period, and a 28-week maintenance period
(Supplementary Fig 1, available via Mendeley at
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vpb6m7gmhn/).
Most efficacy and safety assessments were performed
at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and
every 4 weeks thereafter through week 52 at
investigative sites; the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs
Diary (PSSD) was completed daily by patients through
week 52 (24-hour recall). Patients completing
52 weeks of treatment could enroll in a single-arm,
open-label, long-term extension trial where they
received deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily. Patients
who discontinued or did not enroll in the long-term
extension study were followed for 4 weeks after the
last dose.
Outcome measures
Coprimary efficacy end points were achievement
of PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 (clear/almost clear) with a
$2-point improvement from baseline for deucravacitinib versus placebo at week 16. Key secondary
end points included sPGA 0 (clear), $90% and 100%
reductions from baseline in PASI (PASI 90 and PASI
100), scalp-specific Physician’s Global Assessment
score of 0 or 1 (ss-PGA 0/1) (clear or almost clear),

score of 0 or 1 (PGA-F 0/1) (clear or almost clear);
additional outcomes and hierarchical testing details
are presented in Supplementary Table I, available via
Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/
vpb6m7gmhn/. Patient-reported symptoms and
signs of psoriasis were evaluated using the
PSSD.10,11 Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using
the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Safety data
included adverse events (AEs) (Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities version 23.0), serious AEs
(SAEs), and standard laboratory analytes. An
external data monitoring committee periodically
conducted safety assessments, and blinded external
adjudication committees reviewed specific types of
AEs, including infections, cardiovascular events, and
suicidal ideation and behavior.
Statistical analysis
Sample size calculations were based on superiority testing of deucravacitinib for PASI 75 and sPGA 0/
1 at week 16 versus placebo (coprimary end points)
and versus apremilast. Expected response rates were
60%, 10%, and 35% for deucravacitinib, placebo, and
apremilast, respectively, based on deucravacitinib
phase 2 study results, published placebo response
rates, and apremilast prescribing information.12
Using these assumptions, a sample size of 600
patients was determined to have sufficient statistical
power for analysis of efficacy outcomes and safety
exposure data with deucravacitinib.
Efficacy analyses were performed using the full
analysis set (all randomized patients). Missing data
were imputed by nonresponder imputation for the
coprimary end points; note, as this study was
conducted during the global SARS-CoV2 (COVID19) pandemic, PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 analyses during
weeks 24-52 excluded patients at visits that were
missed solely due to COVID-19, as advised by the US
Food and Drug Administration.13 The modified
baseline-observation-carried-forward method was
used to impute missing data for continuous secondary end points for patients who discontinued study
treatment before week 16 due to lack of efficacy or
AEs. Patients who discontinued study treatment
before week 16 for other reasons had their last valid
observation carried forward (including the baseline
value as applicable).
A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used
to compare PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 response rates at
week 16 in the deucravacitinib versus placebo groups.
Both coprimary end points needed to demonstrate
statistical significance using a 2-sided a level of 0.05
for the study to be considered successful, and statistical analysis of the key secondary end points was
performed in a hierarchical manner only if between-

32 Armstrong et al

group differences in both coprimary end points were
significant (Supplementary Table I, available via
Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/
vpb6m7gmhn/). Testing of additional end points not
in the hierarchy was considered nominal.
Safety analyses were performed using the astreated population (all patients who received $1
dose of study treatment). Week 52 safety data are
reported as exposure-adjusted incidence rates per
100 person-years (PY) to account for variable periods of treatment exposure in the 3 treatment
groups. All analyses were performed using SAS
software (SAS Institute Inc), version 9.4 or higher.

RESULTS
Study participants
Between August 7, 2018, and July 5, 2019, a total
of 666 patients were randomly assigned to treatment
with deucravacitinib 6 mg every day (n = 332),
placebo twice a day (n = 166), or apremilast 30 mg
twice a day (n = 168) (Supplementary Fig 2, available
via Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/
datasets/vpb6m7gmhn/). Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics were similar
across groups and were typical for patients with
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Table I).
Treatment outcomes
Response rates for the 2 coprimary end points
were significantly higher with deucravacitinib versus
placebo: PASI 75 was achieved in 194 (58.4%) versus
21 (12.7%) patients (P \ .0001), and sPGA 0/1 was
achieved in 178 (53.6%) versus 12 (7.2%) patients
(P \ .0001) at week 16 (Table II; Fig 1). Response
rates for PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 continued to improve
through week 24 and were higher with deucravacitinib versus apremilast at weeks 16 and 24 (P \.0001
for each end point; Table II). Deucravacitinib responses were maintained to week 52 with continuous treatment (Fig 2).
Deucravacitinib achieved statistical significance for
multiple other secondary end points versus placebo
and apremilast (Table II, Supplementary Table I,
available via Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.
com/datasets/vpb6m7gmhn/, Supplementary Fig 3,
available via Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.
com/datasets/vpb6m7gmhn/). A greater percentage
of patients treated with deucravacitinib achieved PASI
90 versus patients in the placebo and apremilast
groups at week 16 (35.5% vs 4.2% and 19.6%,
respectively; P \ .0001 vs placebo; P = .0002 vs
apremilast) and versus the apremilast group at week
24 (42.2% vs 22.0%; P \ .0001). Photographs illustrating PASI 90 response in a representative patient are
provided in Supplementary Fig 4, available via

vpb6m7gmhn/. Statistical significance was also
achieved for deucravacitinib versus placebo and
apremilast on measures of complete skin clearance,
including sPGA 0 (17.5% vs 0.6% and 4.8%; P \.0001
for both) and PASI 100 (14.2% vs 0.6% and 3.0%;
P \ .0001 for both) at week 16. In patients with
moderate to severe scalp psoriasis (ss-PGA $3) at
baseline (deucravacitinib, n = 209; placebo, n = 121;
apremilast, n = 110), 70.3% treated with deucravacitinib achieved ss-PGA 0/1 at week 16 versus 17.4%
and 39.1% of patients treated with placebo and
apremilast, respectively (P \ .0001 for both). In the
few patients with moderate to severe fingernail psoriasis (PGA-F $3) at baseline (deucravacitinib, n = 43;
placebo, n = 34), response rates for PGA-F 0/1 at
week 16 were numerically higher with deucravacitinib (20.9%) than with placebo (8.8%).
Greater reduction from baseline in PSSD symptom scores was observed at week 16 with deucravacitinib versus placebo and apremilast (adjusted mean
change from baseline [SE], 26.7 [1.8] vs 3.6 [2.1]
and 17.8 [2.2]; P \ .0001 for both); significant
improvements with deucravacitinib versus placebo
were observed by week 2. The proportion of patients
who achieved a PSSD symptom score of 0 (symptomfree) with deucravacitinib at week 16 (7.9%) was
significantly higher versus placebo (0.7%; P = .0013)
and was numerically higher versus apremilast (4.4%;
P = .17) (Table II). Deucravacitinib-treated patients
reported greater QoL improvements than the other
treatment groups, with a significantly greater
Dermatology Life Quality Index 0/1 response rate
at week 16 (41.0%) versus patients who received
placebo (10.6%; P \ .0001) or apremilast (28.6%;
P = .0088); significant improvements versus placebo
were observed by week 2.
In patients who crossed over from placebo to
deucravacitinib treatment at week 16, clinical responses at week 52 were comparable to patients
who received continuous deucravacitinib treatment
from day 1. This was observed for PASI 75 and sPGA
0/1 (Fig 2) and for change from baseline in PASI
(80.5% vs 78.4%), ss-PGA 0/1 (69.7% vs 65.6%),
and Dermatology Life Quality Index 0/1 (46.1% vs
43.2%), respectively.
Safety
Over 52 weeks, total exposure was 419.1 PY for
deucravacitinib, 46.9 PY for placebo, and 115.8 PY
for apremilast. For the weeks 0-16 and weeks 0-52
assessment periods, AE rates overall were similar
across all 3 treatment groups, and the most frequent
AEs in deucravacitinib-treated patients were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection,

whereas headache, diarrhea, and nausea were more
common with apremilast than in other treatment
groups (Table III).
The frequency of SAEs during weeks 0‒16 was
lowest in the deucravacitinib group (2.1% vs 5.5% with
placebo and 2.4% with apremilast). The incidence
rates of SAEs during weeks 0‒52 were 7.5/100 PY with
deucravacitinib and 5.2/100 PY with apremilast. All
SAEs over 52 weeks occurred in single patients, except
for pericarditis and cholecystitis, which each occurred
in 2 deucravacitinib-treated patients. Discontinuations
due to AEs over weeks 0‒52 were lower with
deucravacitinib (3.3/100 PY) versus placebo (14.7/
100 PY) and apremilast (10.3/100 PY). No AEs leading
to discontinuation occurred in [1 patient receiving
deucravacitinib (Supplementary Table II, available via
Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/

vpb6m7gmhn/). One death occurred in the placebo
group on Day 23 due to hypertensive cardiovascular
disease; no deaths occurred with deucravacitinib or
apremilast (Table III). Incidence rates for AEs of
interest, including skin events (Table III), herpes
zoster (Table III), serious infections (Table III,

blood creatine phosphokinase in all 3 treatment
groups (exposure-adjusted incidence rates: 3.8/100
PY for deucravacitinib, 2.1/100 PY for placebo, and
3.4/100 PY for apremilast), which was typically
associated with recent physical exertion and
resolved without treatment in most cases.

DISCUSSION
Findings from POETYK PSO-1 demonstrated
superiority of deucravacitinib on PASI 75 and sPGA
0/1 at week 16 versus placebo (coprimary end
points) and apremilast. Response rates continued
to increase through week 24 in deucravacitinibtreated patients and were maintained through
week 52. Deucravacitinib treatment was also associated with significantly greater improvements
compared with placebo and apremilast across multiple ranked secondary efficacy end points, including

measures of clear skin and improvements in scalp
psoriasis, psoriasis symptoms, and QoL. Efficacy
outcomes for apremilast in this trial were similar to
those reported with this agent in earlier phase 3 trials
in psoriasis.14,15
Types and rates of AEs, SAEs, and AEs resulting in
treatment discontinuation were generally comparable among patients receiving deucravacitinib, placebo, or apremilast. The most common AEs with
apremilast and those leading to discontinuation were
not unexpected given its known safety profile.
Exposure-adjusted AE incidence was consistent in
the week 0-16 and week 0-52 assessment periods,
and no new relevant AEs emerged with continued
deucravacitinib exposure.

An increased rate of viral infections, most notably
herpes zoster reactivation, has been documented
among patients receiving other immunomodulatory
agents, including anti-interferon-I antibodies, antiIL-23p19 or IL-12/23p40 antibodies, JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors, and antietumor necrosis factor agents.16 In
this study, herpes zoster infections occurred at a low
rate in the deucravacitinib arm (exposure-adjusted
incidence rate, 1.2/100 PY; 95% CI, 0.4-2.8; n = 5,
including 3 Asian patients); all cases were mild to
moderate, localized, followed a benign clinical
course, were not serious, and did not lead to
discontinuation. There was no evidence indicating
an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe
COVID-19 outcomes with deucravacitinib treatment

no meaningful changes during treatment with deucravacitinib in laboratory parameters known to
change with JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors.2,3,19-21 The results

J AM ACAD DERMATOL
VOLUME 88, NUMBER 1

of the present trial are consistent with phase 2
results8,9 and the recently completed phase 3
POETYK PSO-2 trial.
This study was limited by the 1-year duration,
which is short given the chronic nature of psoriasis;
further long-term analyses are warranted to validate
the maintenance of response and long-term safety
profile of deucravacitinib. The POETYK PSO-LTE
trial (NCT04036435) should provide additional
insight into longer-term efficacy and safety of deucravacitinib. Racial diversity was limited in this study
with [98% of patients self-reporting as White or
Asian; applicability to other racial types or ethnicities
needs to be confirmed in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
In POETYK PSO-1, deucravacitinib was well tolerated and demonstrated efficacy that was superior to
placebo and apremilast. As expected based on its
TYK2 selectivity, deucravacitinib did not elicit any
laboratory changes characteristic of JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors. These data highlight the potential for deucravacitinib, a once-daily oral drug, to reduce disease
activity and improve symptoms and QoL among
patients who require systemic therapy for psoriasis.
